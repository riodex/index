This is a graphical user interface for some good ethereum smart contracts.

Click on red words to get a graphical user helper for the corresponding actions.
(Pink words are feature teasers. They don't do anything when you click them.)

Once an action has been set up, click the "ACT !" button to request your client
to <b>sign and broadcast a transaction</b>. Click the "Cancel" button to quit the helper
without generating a transaction.

The help action is used to donate 1 Ether to the riodex.art developers.

Act this action to <b>help</b> the riodex.art developers by sending them 1 ETH.

Remember, click "Cancel" if you do not want to do the action.
